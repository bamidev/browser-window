# Issue Diagnosis

If you are encountering issues while using and/or compiling _Browser Window_, this page is here to help you fix them.
If your issues isn't explained in here, please file the issue [here](https://github.com/bamilab/browser-window/issues).

## Compilation Errors

### Cross-platform

####

```rustc
undefined reference to `base::cef_subtle::RefCountedThreadSafeBase::~RefCountedThreadSafeBase()'
```

This tends to happen when you compile `libcef_dll_wrapper` in release mode.
For some reason, libcef_dll_wrapper doesn't compile these symbols in release
mode. Therefore, currently only build with debug symbols:

```
make clean
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .
make
```

### Unix-like Systems

#### Missing "stdlib.h" or "stddef.h"

```rustc
./src/err.h:8:10: fatal error: 'stdlib.h' file not found
./src/err.h:8:10: fatal error: 'stdlib.h' file not found, err: true
thread 'main' panicked at 'Unable to generate FFI bindings! ...
```

`bindgen` might fail when `clang` isn't properly installed.
To fix this for Debian-like systems, try `apt install libclang-dev`.

### Windows

#### Missing "Windows.h"

```rustc
src/application/win32.h:18:10: fatal error: 'Windows.h' file not found
```

This error occurs when the MSVC compiler can't find the Windows SDK headers.
This could mean that you didn't install the Windows SDK.
If you did, it could also mean that MSVC environment variables aren't set properly.
This tends to happen when using `bindgen` (see feature `bindgen`).

To fix this, call `cargo` from within the 'Cross Tools Command Prompt for VS 20**'.

If you want to work with another type of console, like that of Msys2 for example, you can do to following.
Run `vcvarsall.bat` (usually located in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\BuildTools\VC\Auxiliary\Build`) from the command line with your architecture and SDK version provided as arguments. Run it without arguments for more information.
When this is done, your console should be able to build `browser-window-c`.
But this needs to be done for every console that you want to build _Browser Window_ with, so this is not actually a long-term solution.

#### error LNK2038

```rustc
libcpmt.lib(winapisupp.obj) : error LNK2038: mismatch detected for 'RuntimeLibrary': value 'MT_StaticRelease' doesn't match value 'MD_DynamicRelease' in libbrowser_window_ffi-d71871b45632c28d.rlib(cef.o)
LINK : warning LNK4098: defaultlib 'LIBCMT' conflicts with use of other libs; use /NODEFAULTLIB:library
```

This happends when you didn't follow the getting started guide properly.
You need to built CEF with the `/MD` flag.

### Other C++ Errors

Sometimes you may run into (weird) C++ compilation errors when building _Browser Window_.
If you are using a published version of _Browser Window_, this should generally not happen.
In case it does happen, it is likely to be a incompatibility with the _CEF_ API.
_CEF_ release new major version very regurarely.

Try using a version of _CEF_ that is stated as being the _latest version known to work_, as stated in the [getting started guide](./GETTING-STARTED.md).

If that doesn't work, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/bamilab/browser-window/issues).

## Runtime Errors

### My program executes, but it hangs at the start

For some unknown reason, when you're using CEF on linux, this issue may sometimes happen.
It may hang at where you're using `Application::initialize`.
The source of this bug remains a mystery: https://www.magpcss.org/ceforum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=19719

### Unable to initialize application

```
thread 'main' panicked at 'Unable to initialize application: c(bw) error: [1] unable to execute CEF process (are all required files located near the executable?)', ...
```

This may be because the library and resource files were not copied to your executable directory.
If this is not done, your program will not get past `Application::initialize`.
Execute `setup-cef-files.sh` or `setup-cef-files.bat` if you're trying to run an example.
Otherwise, check the content of these scripts to get an idea of what files need to be copied.

## Resource error

If you're using CEF and are getting this error on application initialization:
```
[1022/131322.883003:ERROR:icu_util.cc(240)] Invalid file descriptor to ICU data received.
```

Then that simply means that the `Resources` files need to live in the same directory as the `libcef.so` file.
